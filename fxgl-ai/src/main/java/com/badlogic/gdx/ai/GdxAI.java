package com.badlogic.gdx.ai;

/** Environment class holding references to the {@link Timepiece}, {@link Logger} instances. The references
 * are held in static fields which allows static access to all sub systems.
 * <p>
 * Basically, this class is the locator of the service locator design pattern. The locator contains references to the services and
 * encapsulates the logic that locates them. Being a decoupling pattern, the service locator provides a global point of access to
 * a set of services without coupling users to the concrete classes that implement them.
 * <p>
 * The gdx-ai framework internally uses the service locator to give you the ability to use the framework out of a libgdx
 * application. In this scenario, the libgdx jar must still be in the classpath but you don't need native libraries since the
 * libgdx environment is not initialized at all.
 * <p>
 * Also, this service locator automatically configures itself with proper service providers in the situations below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Libgdx application: if a running libgdx environment (regardless of the particular backend) is detected.</li>
 * <li>Non-libgdx desktop application: if no running libgdx environment is found.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This means that if you want to use gdx-ai in Android (or any other non desktop platform) out of a lbgdx application then you
 * have to implement and set proper providers.
